# ATS library
- [ ] stack-allocated big integers?
# Build
- [ ] use `Setup.hs` so everything works on hackage like it's supposed to.
- [ ] consider a separate package for installing `patscc`
# Code maintenane
- [ ] test suite for double factorial
- [ ] consider using `arithmoi` for testing?
- [ ] benchmarks in ATS proper (probably interesting?)
# Performance
- [ ] Consider view type for appending arrays?
- [ ] make `totient` faster
- [ ] make `jacobi` faster
# Features
- [ ] coprimality test
- [ ] big omega
- [ ] Euclid's algorithm
- [ ] quadratic residues
- [ ] Jacobi symbol
- [ ] Chinese remainder theorem
- [ ] factor a number (multiplicity?)
- [ ] elliptic curves
- [ ] bell numbers
  - [ ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_number#Properties
- [ ] catalan numbers
- [ ] bernoulli numbers
- [ ] striling numbers of the first kind
