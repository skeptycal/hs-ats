# ATS library
- [ ] stack-allocated big integers?
# Code maintenance
- [ ] benchmarks in ATS proper (probably interesting?)
# Performance
- [ ] Consider view type for appending arrays?
- [ ] make `jacobi` faster
- [ ] make `totientSum` use the right algorithm
# Functions
- [ ] big omega
- [ ] quadratic residues
- [ ] Jacobi symbol
- [ ] Chinese remainder theorem
- [ ] factor a number (multiplicity?)
- [ ] elliptic curves
- [ ] bell numbers
  - [ ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_number#Properties
- [ ] bernoulli numbers
- [ ] striling numbers of the first kind
  - [ ] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stirling_numbers_of_the_first_kind#Recurrence_relation
- [ ] quadratic residues
