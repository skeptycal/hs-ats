# Bugs
- [ ] `derangement` fails for `n=29`?
- [ ] `factorial` fails for `n=56`, `n=33`?
- [ ] `catalan` fails for `n=0`, `n=9`?
# ATS library
- [ ] stack-allocated big integers?
- [x] Package debianization
  - [ ] Header files that actually work with GMP
# Haskell library
- [ ] Consider backpack and/or pure haskell library for when ATS fails?
# Code maintenance
- [ ] benchmarks in ATS proper (probably interesting?)
# Performance
- [ ] Consider view type for appending arrays?
- [ ] make `jacobi` faster
- [ ] make `totientSum` use the right algorithm
- [ ] Use factorial etc. for derangement formula?
- [ ] `bell` is slow compared to haskell?
# Functions
- [ ] big omega
